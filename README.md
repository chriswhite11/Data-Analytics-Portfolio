# Data-Analytics-Portfolio
A portfolio of work from Chris White
In this portfolio it showcases the skills I've learnt in becoming a Data Analyst.
This dataset that I found on Kaggle I have a keen passion for cycling so this is what I chose from my forst project.
It was large dataset and could of gone down many avenues of questiosn that could of been answered.
I choose to look into correlations with countries and trends with product categories,
along with this I looked into the main catagories sub-categories to see the pfofit trends over the collected data years.
I also decided to look into age groups and how they were represented in bike sales across the countries in the data.
Any questions and feedback wlecome.
